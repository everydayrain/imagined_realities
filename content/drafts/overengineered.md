Overview in Brief

Many say, in a sheepish, almost apologetic way, that their homelab is "over-engineered."  

I'm not an engineer by training, so I didn't come up in a cultural setting that stressed simplicity

I don't feel the same sort of imperative to reign in an engineering solution in a lab setting

If anything, I view a lab as a means to understanding.  I build things in my lab to learn how they work, whether or not they are "too" complex, or even whether they serve as a solution for any one thing or another, is not a priroity in my home lab.
