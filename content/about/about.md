Hi, I'm Chris.

I'm switching careers to Cyber Security, and I'm mostly self-taught. I will be using this blog to explore these new interests and the intersection between Cyber Security and Cultural Anthropology. This blog will offer discussion and showcase some of my hobby projects.

In my former career I earned my Ph.D. in cultural anthropology from Rutgers University. I studied how indigenous groups and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) struggled for democratic representation in Peru. Prior to my time at Rutgers I earned an M.A. in Conflict Management in 2009 from the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.

Regarding the webside, you can find out about its title from [this blog post](https://christopherbauer.org/blog/2020-6-17-firstpost/).

This is the second iteration of Imagined Realities. In its current form, it is built using {% linkprimary "Eleventy", "https://www.11ty.dev/" %} and the _11ty-wisp_ theme created by {% linkprimary "Adam DJ Brett", "https://github.com/adamdjbrett/11ty-wisp" %}. I don't have a computer science background, so it will perhaps appear inelegant to someone with a trained eye. Still, it's fun learning and building along the way. I will endeavor to keep this site free of ads and trackers to the extent that such goals are within my control and abilities.

My dissertation is published with ProQuest dissertations and theses. You can also find it filed in [Rutgers' archive](https://doi.org/doi:10.7282/t3-zkh7-ab91).
