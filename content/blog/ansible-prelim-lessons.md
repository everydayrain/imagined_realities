Ansible has fair documentation. Many of the docs however focus narrowly on a given command and its functions. While this can be useful to a seasoned user, some, such as {% linkprimary "Ansible's Vault docs", "https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/index.html" %} don't provide the larger context on how a `ansible-vault` encrypted sudo password is incorporated and deployed in a playbook in conjunction with the Ansible vault password. In this post I'm offering a quick write up of my understanding of this context from early in my study of Ansible.

## When Sudo Requires a Password
One of the trickiest parts of getting started with Ansible has been figuring out how Ansible handles a remote host's password prompts for activities requiring sudo privileges. To remedy this, I created an `ansible-vault` file with the sudo password.

The steps weren't complicated, but how they all fit together was unclear. First, I created a file that would store my password, encrypted, with the dedicated Ansible command.
```shell
ansible-vault create <SOME_FILE.yaml>
```

When the command runs it prompted me to create an Ansible vault password for use in decrypting the file. I saved that Ansible Vault password somewhere safe.

To take advantage of that stored password (i.e. when the remote host prompts during Ansible's run) I next had to specify the path to that password file in my playbook.

Say, for example, I wanted to ensure the correct timezone was set on a remote host. I might create the following task in some playbook. 
```yaml
- name: Set timezone to Los_Angeles
 become: true
 community.general.timezone:
  name: America/Los_Angeles
```

The `become: true` ensures that the task will seek elevated privileges to carry out the timezone change, but it won't have the password for sudo on the remote host. To give Ansible the sudo password, I included the following after `become:true`:
```yaml
 {% raw %}
 vars:
  ansible_become_password: "{{ lookup('ansible.builtin.file', '/PATH/TO/SECRET/PASSWORD/FILE.yml') }}"
 {% endraw %}
```

That `ansible_become_password` variable ensured Ansible sought out the password file I created to complete the sudo password prompt.

Now I was ready to run the playbook.  The last piece involved making sure I added `--ask-vault-pass` as a parameter to the `ansible-playbook` command.  That ensured that Ansible would prompt me for the Vault password needed decrypt the file containing the sudo password and use the sudo password in setting the time.  

Simple right?
