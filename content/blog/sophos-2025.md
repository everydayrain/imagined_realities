This is reprint of my mastodon post of 4/7/25.

Okay, a couple of folks I follow have written about the 2025 Sophos Active Adversary Report but I want to underscore their thoughts and draw attention to few other items.

- Regarding the "lede" about median dwell times falling to two days: its difficult to assess, when Sophos only offers a single simple statistical measure, the significance of that figure Simple statistics should always be reported together to give the reader a more accurate sense of were the median falls in the distribution.  With the median alone, I can't tell if its tightly coupled with the average or whether odd outliers were skewing things.

- Others have commented, with good reason, on the prevalence of uncomplicated root causes such as credential compromise and exploits.  Sophos repeatedly and rightly bangs the MFA drum as well.  The majority of these cases seem like bread and butter stuff for blue teams.  That is not to pass blame but suggest that there's plenty to do before we get to super hackers.

- Speaking of MFA, 64% of victims did not have MFA configured in 2024.  This is the first shocking statistic.

- "logs were missing in 47% of cases" This is the second.  That figure is really striking to me, though the breakdown is not all down to attackers deleting their trails.

- business processes and change management vs security: I feel as though I hear quite a lot about how security is a cost center.  I think this report comes squarely down on the side of "if there isn't adequate security, there won't a business process to carry out."

All in all an interesting report.
